            I have bad anxiety, so my day to day life consists of me needing to do certain things and use particular techniques to calm and centre myself.
            These usually involve, going for a walk, baking, cooking and listening to music. Another thing for me that works is driving.
            And if I have time, driving to Piha and going for a walk with my dog there. Every worry and stress just floats right out! It's now a huge skill of mine.

          Reading the articles provided, I've always kind of gone with those sorts of approaches to things. For instance, the fake it until you make it, philosophy.
          With my anxiety, you just have to keep going, and a huge part of that is faking it until I make it. I know I'm capable of doing anything I want, as long as I apply myself, and most of the time that works.
          No harm in giving it a go.
          However the key is also to be aware of if something isn't working and make the change.
          There is no harm in failing, as long as you gave it a go.

          I think attempting to pursue the Pomodoro Technique will be useful to me. Really planning out my time carefully, and not faffing about - be effcient!
