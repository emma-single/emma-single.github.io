          <h1>Reflection on Sprint-1 </h1>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm terrible at writing about things, so bear with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>What is your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
          <p>
            It's going to be freaking intense and very challenging in many, many aspects. But I knew that it would be when I signed up, so I shouldn't really be very surprised! It seems so far that it's a very supportive environment, and the best option for me to learn this new skillset!
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            I just need to stay focused and not let myself get distracted by other things. I've set myself up so it technically shouldn't be an issue. However, I am a PRO-procrastinator. Seriously, if it was a job, I'd be a bajillionare. But I think this will definitely pay off once it's all wrapped up and done. IF I apply myself and focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a few friends who are web developers, and so I have seen the culture firsthand. I think it is something that I wouldn't find difficult engaging in. I am a bit of a dork.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not at all. I have a few friends of friends who have completed the course, I didn't speak to them directly, but I got a general impression from my friends. It seems to live up to it's rep, so far!
          </p>
          <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, very excited. I think as long as I actually come into the facility, it will work well for me. I learn better if I'm with someone in person and they are able to physically show me what to do. So I'm not nervous at all about that. I'm just nervous that I'll be terrible!!! But I won't let my anxiety stop me from properly trying.
