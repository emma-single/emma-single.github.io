          <h1><strong>Meditation Process</strong></h1>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt like I had a clearer plan of attack when attempting the redesign, rather than just kind of fidling with a bit of this and a bit of that. Causing me to feel like it wasn't completely overwhelming and undoable. Which was helpful! I think I need a bit of practice though.
      </p>
      <p><h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h2></p>
        <p>
          I find my own form of meditation quite useful, on a day to day basis. There are many, many forms in which one can do it, it's not just the stereotypical, sitting there with your legs crossed and your fingers in that typical position. Driving and/or listening to music is a great one for me. As well as baking!
        </p>
      <p><h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2></p>
        <p>
          I guess perhaps be more aware of the steps I take to get to that centred place or whatever. Awareness.
        </p>
      <p><h2>Any other musings?</h2></p>
        <p>
          “Pretty soon, many more people may like you and want to hang out with you.” Gag. I really dislike the writing style of this. It feels childish and painful. I spent most of the time rolling my eyes. I get that he's trying to make it accessible to a younger audience or whatever, but it hurts my being.
